## 📌 About This Project

This tool was built as part of my personal journey learning **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)**. As a new student studying risk mitigation, risk assessment, and compliance frameworks, I wanted to go beyond theory and build something practical that reflects how organizations manage risk in the real world.

The goal was simple — create a tool that makes risk assessment **accessible, visual, and actionable** for any organization or individual trying to understand and manage their risk landscape.

## 🎯 Risk Scoring Matrix

| Score | Rating   |
|-------|----------|
| 20–25 | 🔴 Critical |
| 12–19 | 🟠 High     |
| 6–11  | 🟡 Medium   |
| 1–5   | 🟢 Low      |

> **Score = Likelihood (1–5) × Impact (1–5)**

## 🧠 What I Learned

Building this project helped me understand:

- How **risk scoring frameworks** translate real-world threats into measurable data
- Why **likelihood and impact** are the two core dimensions of any risk assessment
- How frameworks like **NIST** and **ISO 27001** give organizations a structured approach to identifying and responding to risk
- The importance of **risk ownership** and **mitigation tracking** in a GRC program
- How clear visual tools help bridge the gap between **security teams and leadership**
